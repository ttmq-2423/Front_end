About this web application:
This is the product of our specialized project course.
This application aims to detect five types of diseases through frontal chest X-ray images. These five diseases are Cardiovascular Disease, Edema, Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Pleural Effusion.

To achieve this, we have utilized deep learning models to accurately detect and diagnose these diseases. By leveraging the power of neural networks, our application can analyze chest X-ray images with high precision, aiding in early detection and intervention.
